# Metal Detector Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Metal Detector Project, a mechatronics research project conducted by Lutendo Mulaisi for an honors degree at the University of Cape Town. This project focuses on the design and implementation of a metal detector using a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller to sample and process signals.

## Project Overview
Metal detectors are essential tools used for various applications, including security, archaeology, and industrial purposes. In this project, we aim to develop an efficient and accurate metal detection system. The Teensy 4.0 microcontroller serves as the core component for signal processing and control.
